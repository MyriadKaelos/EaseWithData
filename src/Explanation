The programming language java has a relatively steep learning
curve when it comes to branching out. In other words, it's easy
to learn the basics of it, but since it is such a versatile language,
it's incredibly difficult to learn all of java. That's why I made Ease.
With this, I intend to streamline the process of building computer
applications. I have linked the keyboard, mouse, and screen together into
one package, as well as made it possible to connect different versions of
a project across multiple separate computers. This is done using the
Server/Client capabilities already in place by the normal Java framework,
but made more accessible through Ease. I have also made it easier to
paint and create images on the screen. I have done this by simplifying
and shrinking down extensive code used to make rectangles into simple
one-liners.

I have created and Example iteration of the code which I have included in
this file.
Instead of the 30 or so lines of code needed to create a panel with which to
place different visuals, I have simplified that process and made it automatic
whenever ease is used. It now takes one line to do that. It also
automatically connects the keyListener, (which I have utilized to display
the character of whichever key is pressed), the mouseListener, and if
need be, made it automatically connect a server with its client.
